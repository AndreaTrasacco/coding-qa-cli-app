# Coding Q&A
Coding Q&A is a “forum – social network” thought to allow developers to share their daily problems with a community of other developers. 
The latter can try to give advices to the ones that ask for clarifications and problem solving. 
Therefore, the application is mainly based on questions and answers between programmers, but it also allows the computation of some analytics based on the users and their activities.

## Software Architecture
Coding Q&A has client-server architecture composed of a Java console application as client side, implemented following the MVC pattern, and two databases on the server side. 
The two databases are NoSQL databases: MongoDB and Neo4j.
